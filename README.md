# Cardiac-Rearrests-Prediction-Using-HRV-and-ML-Algorithms
Research project that pursues being able to predict cardiac rearrest by means of analyzing Heart Rate Variability (HRV) matrixes and comparing the accuracy of different Machine Learning (ML) techniques such as Tree Sorting or Logistic Regression

BASIC USAGE

1) download data file EBME 421 Project - HRV Files.xlsx
2) open main.py
3) create a folder in which you would like to store the results files
4) copy the data directory directry in line # of main.py
5) copy the results folder directory in line # of main.py
6) run script and access the files generated in the folder after finish
